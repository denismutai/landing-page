Abstract: The willow tree is a symbolic medicinal plant that has been associated with the discovery of aspirin, chemically known as acetylsalicylic acid, or salicylate, which still offers surprises as a revival drug. The philosophical perspective of the significance of the willow tree has been elaborated since the Assyrians (4000 BC) and Sumerians (3500 BC), who were aware of its medicinal merits. In 1838, the main pharmacologically active ingredient of willow, the salicin structure was elucidated by hydrolysis to comprise D-glucose and salicyl alcohol. These uncovered new perspectives, which eventually lead to the discovery of aspirin.
